# DreamJournal 
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
The Dream Journal project is a functional application created using Android Studio. 
Users of the application can add, save, and edit any journal entries of dreams the user has dreamt. 
Another feature the application has is the ability to interpret a specific dream through the OpenAI integrated into the application. 
The User simply taps on the “AI Interpretation” tab and types in their dream in the textbox. 
When done, the user taps on the generate button and the AI gives a general interpretation of what the dream might symbolize. 
Kotlin and Java were both used to create the application. Kotlin was used to integrate the OpenAI’s API while Java was used to create the functional interface of the OpenAI.
